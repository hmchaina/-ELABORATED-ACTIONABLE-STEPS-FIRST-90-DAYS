   - Document: "How physical security translates to cybersecurity"

3. Flashcards (15 min):
   Create 10 Anki cards for:
   - Malware vs. Ransomware

Day 2 (Tuesday): Malware & Attack Types

EVENING SESSION:
1. Study (45 min):

   - Document behavior in isolated VM

3. Practical Application (30 min):
   Write a short comparison:
   "Physical Security Breach vs. Malware Infection"
   Example:
   Physical: Unauthorized access → CCTV detection
   Digital: Unauthorized code → Antivirus detection

   EVENING SESSION:
1. Study (45 min):
   - Professor Messer Video 1.2 - Social Engineering
   - YOUR ADVANTAGE: You've seen tailgating, pretexting, etc.
   - Document 3 real physical social engineering incidents you witnessed

2. Lab (45 min):
   - Set up email client in VM
   - Analyze phishing email samples (use Phishing Test from KnowBe4)
   - Document red flags

3. Flashcards (15 min):
   - Phishing vs. Spear phishing vs. Whaling
   - Vishing vs. Smishing
   - Pretexting vs. Baiting
  
  Day 3 (Wednesday): Social Engineering

 EVENING SESSION:
1. Study (45 min):
   - Professor Messer Video 1.2 - Social Engineering
   - YOUR ADVANTAGE: You've seen tailgating, pretexting, etc.
   - Document 3 real physical social engineering incidents you witnessed

2. Lab (45 min):
   - Set up email client in VM
   - Analyze phishing email samples (use Phishing Test from KnowBe4)
   - Document red flags

3. Flashcards (15 min):
   - Phishing vs. Spear phishing vs. Whaling

   - Pretexting vs. Baiting
  
Day 4 (Thursday): Application Attacks

EVENING SESSION:
1. Study (45 min):
   - Professor Messer Video 1.3 - Application Attacks
   - Book: Buffer overflows, injection attacks
   - YOUR CONNECTION: Compare to "physical bypass" techniques

2. Lab (60 min):
   - Install OWASP Juice Shop (vulnerable web app)
   - Access via browser in VM
   - Complete first 2 challenges
   - Document findings

3. Practice Questions (15 min):
   - 10 questions from ExamCompass Domain 1
  
Day 5 (Friday): Cryptographic Attacks

EVENING SESSION:
1. Study (45 min):
   - Professor Messer Video 1.4 - Cryptographic Attacks
   - Book: Chapter on cryptography basics
   - Focus: How encryption failures = security system failures

2. Lab (45 min):
   - Use CyberChef (online tool)
   - Practice encoding/decoding Base64, Hex, ROT13
   - Document: "How encoding isn't encryption"

3. Week Review (30 min):
   - Review all Anki cards (now ~50 cards)
   - Update GitHub with week summary

Weekend (Saturday/Sunday): Consolidation

SATURDAY (3 hours):
1. Review Domain 1.0 (90 min):
   - Rewatch any unclear Professor Messer videos
   - Complete Domain 1 practice test (ExamCompass)

2. Lab Extension (90 min):
   - TryHackMe "Pre-Security" Room 1 & 2
   - Document completion certificates
   - Update LinkedIn: "Completed TryHackMe Pre-Security Path"

SUNDAY (2 hours):
1. Practical Project:
   - Create "Physical-to-Cyber Security Comparison" chart
   - Post on LinkedIn (builds credibility)
   Example row:
   | Physical Security | Cybersecurity Equivalent | Tools Used |
   |-------------------|-------------------------|------------|
   | Access Control    | Authentication          | Badge = Password |
   | CCTV Monitoring   | SIEM Monitoring         | Cameras = Logs |

2. Plan Week 2:
   - Schedule study times in calendar
   - Prepare materials for Domain 2.0
